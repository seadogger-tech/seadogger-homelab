# Project Brief: seadogger-homelab

This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the `seadogger-homelab` project.

## Core Requirements

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and well-documented guide for deploying a Kubernetes (k3s) cluster on a set of Raspberry Pi 5 nodes. The deployment should be automated using Ansible and manage applications via ArgoCD, following GitOps best practices.

## Key Goals

*   **Reproducibility:** The setup and deployment process should be clearly documented and scripted to allow others to reproduce the homelab environment with minimal effort.
*   **Automation:** Leverage Ansible for infrastructure provisioning and configuration to ensure consistency and reduce manual intervention.
*   **GitOps:** Use ArgoCD to manage all Kubernetes applications, ensuring that the cluster state is defined declaratively in a Git repository.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide detailed guides, diagrams, and explanations covering hardware setup, software configuration, and operational procedures.
*   **Extensibility:** The architecture should be modular to allow for the addition of new services and applications over time.
