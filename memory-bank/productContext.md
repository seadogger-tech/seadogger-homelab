# Product Context: seadogger-homelab

This document details the "why" behind the `seadogger-homelab` project, the problems it solves, and the intended user experience.

## Problem Statement

Setting up a personal homelab, especially a Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi hardware, can be a complex and error-prone process. Many guides are incomplete, outdated, or lack the automation needed for a reliable and maintainable setup. This project aims to solve that by providing a comprehensive, automated, and well-documented solution.

## Target Audience

*   **Hobbyists and Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in learning about Kubernetes, cloud-native technologies, and running their own services at home.
*   **Developers:** Engineers who want a local development environment that mirrors production cloud environments.
*   **Students and Learners:** Anyone looking for a hands-on project to understand modern infrastructure and DevOps practices.

## How It Works

The project provides a set of Ansible playbooks and Kubernetes manifests that automate the entire setup process, from configuring the Raspberry Pi nodes to deploying a suite of useful applications. Users clone the repository, customize a few configuration files, and run a single command to bring up the entire cluster.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Simplicity:** The setup process should be as simple as possible, abstracting away much of the underlying complexity.
*   **Clarity:** The documentation should be clear, concise, and easy to follow, with diagrams and examples to aid understanding.
*   **Reliability:** The resulting homelab should be stable and reliable, providing a solid platform for running various services.
*   **Flexibility:** While providing a default set of applications, the project should be flexible enough to allow users to easily add or remove services to suit their needs.
