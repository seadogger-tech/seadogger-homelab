# --- Granular Cleanup Configuration ---
# ==============================================================================
#
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# This section controls the NEW `cleanup.yml` playbook (`ansible-playbook cleanup.yml`).
# It allows for the targeted, graceful removal of applications and infrastructure.
# It is SEPARATE from the `main.yml` deployment playbook.
#
# --- COMMON PATTERNS ---
#
# 1. To Remove a SINGLE POD (e.g., plex):
#    - Set `run_pod_cleanup: true`
#    - In `pod_cleanup_list`, ensure only the `plex` entry is present or uncommented.
#    - Set `delete_pvc: false` for plex to keep its data.
#
# 2. To Remove a SINGLE POD AND ITS DATA (e.g., pihole):
#    - Set `run_pod_cleanup: true`
#    - In `pod_cleanup_list`, ensure only the `pihole` entry is present.
#    - Set `delete_pvc: true` for pihole.
#
# 3. To Remove ALL PODS:
#    - Set `run_pod_cleanup: true`
#    - Ensure all desired applications are listed in `pod_cleanup_list`.
#
# 4. To Remove Prometheus (including its CRDs):
#    - Set `run_prometheus_cleanup: true`
#
# 5. To Remove Infrastructure (e.g., MetalLB only):
#    - Set `run_infrastructure_cleanup: true`
#    - Set `infrastructure_cleanup_list: ["metallb"]`
#
# 6. To Wipe Everything (COLD START):
#    - Set `cold_start_stage_1_wipe_cluster: true` below.
#    - Then run the `ansible-playbook cleanup.yml` command. This will trigger
#      the full, ordered teardown of all applications and infrastructure before
#      wiping the k3s cluster itself.
#
# SAFETY: The `main.yml` playbook can NO LONGER perform any destructive actions.
# All teardown operations MUST be initiated via `cleanup.yml`.
# Physical disk wiping is still protected by the separate `perform_physical_disk_wipe` flag.
